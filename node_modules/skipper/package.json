  "readme": "<h1>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/balderdashy/skipper\"><img alt=\"Skipper logo\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/P6gptnI.png\" title=\"Skipper\"/></a>\n</h1>\n\n[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/skipper.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/skipper) &nbsp;\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/balderdashy/skipper.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/balderdashy/skipper)  &nbsp;\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/balderdashy/sails?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n\n\nSkipper makes it easy to implement streaming file uploads to disk, S3, or any supported file upload adapters.\n\n============================================\n\n\n## Quick Start\n\nThe following example assumes skipper is already installed as the body parser in your Express or Sails app. It receives one or more files from a **file parameter** named `avatar` using the default, built-in file adapter (skipper-disk).  This streams the file(s) to the default upload directory `.tmp/uploads/` on the server's local disk.\n\n```javascript\nreq.file('avatar').upload(function (err, uploadedFiles){\n  if (err) return res.send(500, err);\n  return res.send(200, uploadedFiles);\n});\n```\n============================================\n\n\n## Installation\n\nSkipper is installed in [Sails](http://beta.sailsjs.org) automatically (see https://github.com/sails101/file-uploads for a sample Sails app that handles file uploads).\n\nTo install Skipper in a vanilla [Express](http://expressjs.org) app:\n\n```sh\nnpm install skipper --save\n```\n\n```js\napp.use(require('skipper')());\n```\n\n============================================\n\n\n## Global options\n\nSkipper accepts several options when it is first instantiated that allow you to configure how it behaves, including various timeouts.  See the [&ldquo;Configuring Skipper&rdquo; docs on sailshs.org](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/configuration/sails-config-http#?configuring-skipper) for more information.\n\n\n## Using `req.file(...).upload()`\n\nAs is true with most methods on `req`, usage of Skipper's `req.file()` is identical between Sails (in a controller) and Express (in a route).\n\n```javascript\nreq.file('avatar').upload(function (err, uploadedFiles) {\n  if (err) return res.send(500, err);\n  return res.json({\n    message: uploadedFiles.length + ' file(s) uploaded successfully!',\n    files: uploadedFiles\n  });\n});\n```\n\n#### Options\n\n Option      | Type                             | Description\n ----------- | -------------------------------- | --------------\n dirname     | ((string))                       | Optional. The path to the directory on the remote filesystem where file uploads should be streamed.  May be specified as an absolute path (e.g. `/Users/mikermcneil/foo`) or a relative path.  In the latter case, or if no `dirname` is provided, the configured filesystem adapter will determine a `dirname` using a conventional default (varies adapter to adapter).  If `dirname` is used with `saveAs`- the filename from saveAs will be relative to dirname.\n saveAs      | ((string)) -or- ((function))     | Optional.  By default, Skipper decides an \"at-rest\" filename for your uploaded files (called the `fd`) by generating a UUID and combining it with the file's original file extension when it was uploaded (\"e.g. 24d5f444-38b4-4dc3-b9c3-74cb7fbbc932.jpg\"). <br/>  If `saveAs` is specified as a string, any uploaded file(s) will be saved to that particular path instead (should only be used for simple, single-file uploads).<br/> When used with multi-file uploads, `saveAs` should be specified as a function.  This function will be called _each time a file is received_, and Skipper will pass it the raw file stream (`__newFileStream`) and a callback (`next`).   If something goes critically wrong, your `saveAs` function should trigger its callback with an Error instance as the first argument (e.g. `return next(new Error('Could not determine appropriate filename.'));`).  Otherwise, it should call its callback with `undefined` as the first argument, and pass in the `fd` string as the second argument. For example: <br/> `saveAs: function (__newFileStream, next) { return next(undefined, 'the-uploaded-file.txt'); }` <br/>If a file already exists with the same `fd`, it will be overridden.<br/>The final file descriptor (`fd`) for the upload will be resolved relative from `dirname`.\n maxBytes    | ((integer))                      | Optional. Max total number of bytes permitted for a given upload, calculated by summing the size of all files in the upstream; e.g. if you created an upstream that watches the \"avatar\" field (`req.file('avatar')`), and a given request sends 15 file fields with the name \"avatar\", `maxBytes` will check the total number of bytes in all of the 15 files.  If maxBytes is exceeded, the already-written files will be left untouched, but unfinshed file uploads will be garbage-collected, and not-yet-started uploads will be cancelled.  (Note that `maxBytes` is currently experimental)\n onProgress  | ((function))                     | Optional. This function will be called again and again as the upstream pumps chunks into the receiver with an object representing the current status of the upload, until the upload completes.  Currently experimental.\n\n\n============================================\n\n\n## Use Cases\n\n\n#### Uploading files to disk\n\n[skipper-disk](https://github.com/balderdashy/skipper-disk) is a file adapter that uploads files to the local hard drive on the server.  It is bundled with Skipper, so if an `adapter` option is not specified (as in the [Quick Start](#quick-start) example above) it is used by default.\n\n```js\nreq.file('avatar').upload({\n  // ...any other options here...\n}, ...);\n```\n\nIt exposes the following adapter-specific options:\n\n Option     | Type                             | Description\n ---------- | -------------------------------- | --------------\n onProgress | ((function))                     | A notifier function triggered with a report of upload progress.\n\n\n#### Uploading files to S3\n\n```shell\n$ npm install skipper-s3 --save\n```\n\n[skipper-s3](https://github.com/balderdashy/skipper-s3) is a filesystem adapter which enables Skipper to stream file uploads directly to Amazon S3.\n\n```js\nreq.file('avatar').upload({\n  // ...any other options here...\n  adapter: require('skipper-s3'),\n  key: 'YOUR_S3_API_KEY',\n  secret: 'YOUR_S3_API_SECRET',\n  bucket: 'YOUR_S3_BUCKET',\n  headers: {\n    'x-amz-acl': 'YOUR_FILE_PERMISSIONS'\n  }\n}, ...);\n```\n\nIt exposes the following adapter-specific options:\n\n Option     | Type                             | Description\n ---------- | -------------------------------- | --------------\n key        | ((string))                       | Your AWS \"Access Key ID\", e.g. `\"BZIZIZFFHXR27BFUOZ7\"` (_required_)\n secret     | ((string))                       | Your AWS \"Secret Access Key\", e.g. `\"L8ZN3aP1B9qkUgggUnEZ6KzrQJbJxx4EMjNaWy3n\"` (_required_)\n bucket     | ((string))                       | The bucket to upload your files into, e.g. `\"my_cool_file_uploads\"` (_required_)\n endpoint   | ((string))                       | By default all requests will be sent to the global endpoint `s3.amazonaws.com`. But if you want to manually set the endpoint, you can do it with the endpoint option. |\n region     | ((string))                       | The S3 region where the bucket is located, e.g. `\"us-west-2\"`. Note: If `endpoint` is defined, `region` will be ignored. Defaults to `\"us-standard\"` |\n tmpdir     | ((string))                       | The path to the directory where buffering multipart requests can rest their heads.  Amazon requires \"parts\" sent to their multipart upload API to be at least 5MB in size, so this directory is used to queue up chunks of data until a big enough payload has accumulated.  Defaults to `.tmp/s3-upload-part-queue` (resolved from the current working directory of the node process- e.g. your app)\n headers    | ((object))                       | A set of headers to be added to the upload request.  See the Amazon S3 [PUT Object docs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectPUT.html#RESTObjectPUT-requests) for info about the available headers, and the [canned ACL docs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl) for a list of access-control settings you can use with the `x-amz-acl` header to specify permissions for your uploaded files\n\n\n#### Uploading files to PostgreSQL\n\n```shell\n$ npm install skipper-postgresql --save\n```\n\n[**skipper-postgresql**](https://github.com/waterlinejs/skipper-postgresql) allows Skipper to store files in a PostgreSQL database.\n\n\n#### Uploading files to gridfs\n\n```shell\n$ npm install skipper-gridfs --save\n```\n\n[skipper-gridfs](https://github.com/willhuang85/skipper-gridfs) is a filesystem adapter which enables Skipper to stream file uploads directly to MongoDB's GridFS.\n\n```js\nreq.file('avatar').upload({\n  // ...any other options here...\n  adapter: require('skipper-gridfs'),\n  uri: 'mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][/[database[.bucket]]'\n}, ...);\n```\n\nIt exposes the following adapter-specific options:\n\n Option    | Type                             | Description\n --------- | -------------------------------- | --------------\n uri       | ((string))                       | the MongoDB database where uploaded files should be stored (using [mongo client URI syntax](http://api.mongodb.org/java/current/com/mongodb/MongoClientURI.html)) <br/> e.g. `mongodb://jimmy:j1mtr0n1xx@mongo.jimmy.com:27017/coolapp.avatar_uploads`\n\n> **Note:** As of `skipper-gridfs@0.5.3`, this adapter [does not currently support Node versions >= v4.0](https://gitter.im/balderdashy/sails?at=56a737d0c54bc2bf180c0d06).\n\n\n#### Uploading files to Openstack Swift\n\n```shell\n$ npm install skipper-openstack --save\n```\n\n[skipper-openstack](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/skipper-openstack) is a filesystem adapter which enables Skipper to stream file uploads directly to Openstack blob storage, Swift.\n\n```js\nreq.file('avatar').upload({\n  // ...any other options here...\n  adapter: require('skipper-openstack'),\n  credentials: {\n    region: \"YOUR_REGION\",\n    userId: \"YOUR_USER_ID\"\n    password: \"YOUR_PASSWORD\"\n    auth_url: \"YOUR_AUTH_URL\"\n    projectId: \"YOUR_TENANT_ID\"\n  },\n  container: \"YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME\"\n}, ...);\n```\n\n#### Uploading files to Azure\n\n```shell\n$ npm install skipper-azure --save\n```\n\n[skipper-azure](https://github.com/lukasreichart/skipper-azure) is a filesystem adapter which enables Skipper to stream file uploads directly to Azure blob storage.\n\n```js\nreq.file('avatar').upload({\n  // ...any other options here...\n  adapter: require('skipper-azure'),\n  key: 'YOUR_AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT',\n  secret: 'YOUR_AZURE_API_SECRET',\n  container: 'YOUR_AZURE_CONTAINER'\n}, ...);\n```\n\nIt exposes the following adapter-specific options:\n\n Option     | Type                             | Description\n ---------- | -------------------------------- | --------------\n key        | ((string))                       | Your Azure \"Storage Account\", e.g. `\"my_storage\"` (_required_)\n secret     | ((string))                       | Your Azure \"Primary Secret Access Key\", e.g. `\"L8ZN3aP1B9qkUgggUnEZ6KzrQJbJxx4EMjNaWy3n\"` (_required_)\n container  | ((string))                       | The container to upload your files into, e.g. `\"my_cool_file_uploads\"` (_required_)\n\n\n<!--\n============================================\n\n#### Customizing at-rest filenames for uploads\n\n> TODO: document `saveAs`\n\n#### Restricting file size\n\n> TODO: document `maxBytes`\n\n\n  #### Preventing/allowing uploads of a certain file type\n> TODO\n\n#### Compressing uploaded files\n> TODO\n\n#### Encrypting uploaded files\n> TODO\n\n#### Creating thumbnails for uploaded images\n> TODO\n-->\n\n============================================\n\n\n## Background\n\nSkipper extends the [HTTP body parser used in Sails and Express](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser).\n\nIt parses multipart requests (file uploads) using [andrewrk/node-multiparty](https://github.com/andrewrk/node-multiparty), but instead of buffering to a `tmp` directory on disk, it exposes uploaded files as streams.  This allows Skipper to run your application code _before the file uploads are saved_ affording a number of benefits.  Additionally, Skipper implements a file adapter specification that can be used to connect \"upstreams\" with various APIs (Box.net, imgur, whatever) with minimal integration effort.\n\n\n#### File Adapters\n\nThe upstreams you get from `req.file()` can be hooked up to any compatible skipper adapter (e.g. local filesystem, S3, grid-fs).  File upload adapters maintain a consistent specification for certain options/features; things like specifying the at-rest filename for a file upload or indicating the maximum upload size for a particular request.  However some file adapters may provide additional functionality/options which are not part of the specification-- that's ok too!  When possible, new features/options introduced by individual adapters will be standardized and pulled into the core spec, where they can be uniformly tested (in an adapter-agnostic way) using the skipper-adapter-tests module (inspired by the approach taken in [waterline-adapter-tests](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline-adapter-tests))\n\n#### Stream Processing\n\nWorking with upstreams means you can process file uploads in flight-- _before_ they land on your server.  This makes features like terrabyte file uploads (or ∞-byte, for that matter) a possibility by allowing you to restrict/limit uploads without receiving the entire thing.  You can even tap into the raw file streams to peform streaming encryption, compression, or even image thumbnailing (although currently this requires implementing your own stream processing logic.  Simple, one-line configuration to opt into those features is on the roadmap.)\n\n#### Lazy Stream Initialization\n\nSkipper only examines/processes any given file upload for as long as it takes to determine whether it is _actually used_ by your app.  For instance, if you don't write `req.file('foo')` in your app code, the stream will be ignored, whether it contains a 25KB image or a 30TB binary payload. This conserves valuable system resources and reducing the effectiveness of would-be DoS attacks.\n\n#### Text Parameters\n\nIn addition to providing access to incoming file uploads as raw streams, Skipper allows you to access the other _non-file_ metadata parameters (e.g \"photoCaption\" or \"commentId\") in the conventional way.  That includes url/JSON-encoded HTTP body parameters (`req.body`), querystring parameters (`req.query`), or \"route\" parameters (`req.params`); in other words, all the standard stuff sent in standard AJAX uploads or HTML form submissions.  And helper methods like `req.param()` and `req.allParams()` work too.\n\n> It is important to realize that the benefit above **relies on a crucial, simplifying assumption**: that user agents send any **text parameters** _before_ the first **file parameter** in the multipart HTTP request body.  For instance, in an HTML form that means putting all of your `<input type=\"file\"/>` tags **after** the other inputs.  If you don't want to lay your form out that way, you'll want to use AJAX to submit it instead (see [jQuery File Upload](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload) / [Angular File Upload](https://github.com/danialfarid/angular-file-upload)) or listen for the form's \"submit\" event to reorder the inputs before submitting the form to the server.\n\n\n#### The Big Assumption: Field Order\n\nAfter a lot of research, @zolmeister, @sgress454 and I came to understand a critical fact about multipart form data: that fields are sent _in order_ by browsers.  This is true even as far back as IE6!\n\n+ http://stackoverflow.com/a/7450170/486547\n+ http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4\n+ https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/issues/670#issue-3711585\n\n\n#### History\n\nThis module ~~may~~ ~~_will be_~~ **is** included as the default body parser in Sails, and has been since v0.10 when [file upload support was removed from Express](http://andrewkelley.me/post/do-not-use-bodyparser-with-express-js.html). The decision to include skipper in core was tough, since it _is_ quite opinionated.  But given the spotty/fragmented/confusing state of MPU implementations around the Node community, we didn't feel comfortable throwing out built-in support for file uploads.  We hope this module helps clear things up for everybody.\n\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### How do I customize the Skipper options in my Sails app?\n\nIn Sails v0.12.x on, simply configure the `sails.config.http.middleware.bodyParser` setting in `config/http.js` with a Skipper instance using your desired options:\n\n```\n// config/http.js\n\nmodule.exports.http = {\n\n  middleware: {\n\n    bodyParser: require('skipper')({\n      maxWaitTimeBeforePassingControlToApp: 1000\n    })\n\n  }\n\n};\n```\n\nIn Sails &lt; v0.12.x, you&rsquo;ll need to comment-out `bodyParser` from the middleware order, and replace it with a \"custom\" middleware.  For example:\n\n```\n\n// config/http.js\n\nmodule.exports.http = {\n\n  middleware: {\n\n    // The order in which middleware should be run for HTTP request.\n    // (the Sails router is invoked by the \"router\" middleware below.)\n    order: [\n      'startRequestTimer',\n      'cookieParser',\n      'session',\n      // 'bodyParser', // <-- don't add the \"bodyParser\" middleware to the stack\n      'skipper',   // <-- instead use this \"custom\" middleware\n      'handleBodyParserError',\n      'compress',\n      'methodOverride',\n      'poweredBy',\n      '$custom',\n      'router',\n      'www',\n      'favicon',\n      '404',\n      '500'\n    ],\n\n    // Configure Skipper\n    skipper: require('skipper')({\n      maxWaitTimeBeforePassingControlToApp: 1000\n    })\n\n  }\n\n};\n```\n\n#### How Does the Multipart Body Parser Work?\n\n_When a multipart request is received..._\n\n1. Skipper waits _just long enough_ to identify the first file being uploaded in a request, then gathers up all the text parameters it's seen _so far_ and **runs** your application code (i.e. calls `next()`).\n\n2. In your application code, you call `req.file('foo')` to listen for file uploads sent as the \"foo\" parameter.  This returns an \"upstream\"-- a stream of binary file streams; one for each file that was uploaded to the specified parameter (\"foo\") via an HTTP multipart file upload.  At that point, if Skipper has already seen files come in as \"foo\", it will start uploading to the file adapter.  This involves replaying the first buffered bytes its received of \"foo\" file uploads so far and \"pumping\" those streams so they start sending more bytes; i.e. relieving TCP backpressure.  If Skipper has NOT already received any files as \"foo\", it will start listening for them.\n\n3. When the request ends, or a significant (configurable) period of time has passed since a new file upload has shown up on \"foo\", the upstream is considered to be complete.  If you're using `req.file('foo').upload(function(err,uploadedFiles){ ... })`, the callback will be triggered with `uploadedFiles` as an array of metadata objects describing the files that were uploaded (including the at-rest file descriptor.)   If an error occured, the callback will be triggered with `err` instead.  (Note that, if you're using the raw upstream directly, you can listen for the \"finish\" and \"error\" events to achieve the same effect.)\n\n4. In general, when possible, you should put `req.file()` outside of asynchronous callbacks in your code.  However this isn't always possible-- Skipper tolerates this case \"holding on\" to unrecognized file streams (e.g. \"bar\") for a configurable period of time. If you don't use `req.file(\"bar\")` right away in your code, Skipper will \"hold on\" to any files received on that parameter (\"bar\").  However it __won't pump bytes from those files__ until you use `req.file('bar')` in your code.  It does this without buffering to disk/memory by properly implementing Node's streams2 interface, which applies TCP backpressure and _actually slows down_, or even pauses, the upload.  If you __never__ use `req.file('bar')` in your code, any unused pending file streams received on \"bar\" will be discarded when the request ends.\n\n\n\n#### What are Upstreams?\n\nAn upstream is an [object-mode Readable stream](http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_object_mode) of [Readable streams](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable).  It's purpose is to pump out incoming files.\n\nWhen you call `req.file('foo')`, the upstream for the \"foo\" parameter in the current request (`req`) is lazy-initialized and returned (subsequent calls to `req.file('foo')` will return the same upstream, calling `req.file('bar')` will return the upstream for \"bar\", etc.).\n\n\n```\n•---------------------•\n|   req.file('foo')   |   <------- an upstream\n•----====-------------•\n     |  |\n     |  |\n     |f2|     <------- an incoming file upload stream\n     |  |\n     |  |\n     |f1|     <------- an incoming file upload stream\n     |  |\n     |  |\n     |f0|     <------- an incoming file upload stream\n    _|  |_\n    \\    /\n     \\  /\n      \\/\n```\n\n\n\n#### What are Upstream Receivers?\n\n\nAn **upstream receiver** is an [object-mode Writable stream](http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_object_mode) of [Writable streams](http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_writable).\n\nIt's purpose is to receive incoming files that get pumped out of an upstream.  Whenever a new file shows up, the receiver's `_write()` method gets called, and the receiver writes it to the remote filesystem.\n\n\n```\n•-----------------•\n|  some upstream  |\n•----====---------•\n     |  |\n     |  |\n     |f2|   <------- an incoming file upload stream\n     |  |\n     |  |\n     |f1|   <------- an incoming file upload stream\n     |  |\n     |  |\n     |f0|   <------- an incoming file upload stream\n    _|  |_\n    \\    /\no----ª==ª----o\n|  receiver  |\no------------o\n```\n\n\n#### What are Filesystem Adapters?\n\nA **filesystem adapter** is a node module which exports an object with the following functions:\n\n Method      | Description\n ----------- | ------------------\n `ls()`      | Get the contents of the specified directory on the remote filesystem (returns an array of string file/folder names)\n `read()`    | Get a file from the remote filesystem\n `rm()`      | Remove a file or directory from the remote filesystem\n `receive()` | Return an \"upstream receiver\" which will receive files pumped from an upstream and write them to the remote filesystem\n\nAt present, the first three methods are actually only used by skipper-adapter-tests to test your module.  That said, it is unlikely that any of one them involves writing more than ~5-20 lines of code, so it's worth it to create them so you can use the generic test suite.  See [skipper-disk](https://github.com/balderdashy/skipper-disk/blob/master/index.js#L27) or [skipper-s3](https://github.com/balderdashy/skipper-s3/blob/master/index.js#L54) for example implementations.\n\nThe most important method is `receive()` -- it builds the upstream receiver which is responsible for writing incoming files to the remote filesystem.\n\n\n<!--\n TODO: simplify the API for building receivers- we could make it so you really only need to define the _write() method\n-->\n\n\n============================================\n\n\n## Low-Level Usage\n\n> **Warning:**\n> You probably shouldn't try doing anything in this section unless you've implemented streams before, and in particular _streams2_ (i.e. \"suck\", not \"spew\" streams).\n\n\n\n#### File adapter instances, receivers, upstreams, and binary streams\n\nFirst instantiate a blob adapter (`blobAdapter`):\n\n```js\nvar blobAdapter = require('skipper-disk')();\n```\n\nBuild a receiver (`receiving`):\n\n```js\nvar receiving = blobAdapter.receive();\n```\n\nThen you can stream file(s) from a particular field (`req.file('foo')`):\n\n```js\nreq.file('foo').upload(receiving, function (err, filesUploaded) {\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\n#### `upstream.pipe(receiving)`\n\nAs an alternative to the `upload()` method, you can pipe an incoming **upstream** returned from `req.file()` (a Readable stream of Readable binary streams) directly to the **receiver** (a Writable stream for Upstreams.)\n\n\n```js\nreq.file('foo').pipe(receiving);\n```\n\nThere is no performance benefit to using `.pipe()` instead of `.upload()`-- they both use streams2.  The `.pipe()` method is available merely as a matter of flexibility/chainability.  Be aware that `.upload()` handles the `error` and `finish` events for you; if you choose to use `.pipe()`, you will of course need to listen for these events manually:\n\n```js\nreq.file('foo')\n.on('error', function onError() { ... })\n.on('finish', function onSuccess() { ... })\n.pipe(receiving)\n```\n\nAlso bear in mind that you must first intercept the upstream and attach an `fd` (file descriptor) property to each incoming file stream.\n\nGenerally, you're better off sticking with the standard usage.\n\n\n#### Implementing `receive()`\n\nThe `receive()` method in a filesystem adapter must build and return a new upstream receiver.\n\nThis is the hardest part-- if you implement this, everything else in your adapter is a piece of cake.  Here's a quick walk-through of how you can build and return a upstream receiver instance:\n\n\n```js\n\nfunction receive() {\n\n  // Build an instance of a writable stream in object mode.\n  var receiver__ = require('stream').Writable({ objectMode: true });\n\n  // This `_write` method is invoked each time a new file is pumped in\n  // from the upstream.  `__newFile` is a readable binary stream.\n  receiver__._write = function onFile(__newFile, _unused, done) {\n\n    // If you are piping to this receiver using Skipper, adapter options like \"bucket\"\n    // will be available as `__newFile.options` (otherwise it will be an empty object).\n    var options = __newFile.options;\n\n\n    // To determine location where file should be written on remote filesystem,\n    // calculate the output path as follows:\n    var outputPath = require('path').join(__newFile.dirname, __newFile.fd);\n\n\n    // Then ensure necessary parent directories exist\n    // ...\n\n    // Create/acquire a writable stream to the remote filesystem\n    // (this may involve using options like \"bucket\", \"secret\", etc. to build an appropriate request)\n    // ...\n    var outs__ = getWriteStreamSomehow(outputPath, encoding);\n\n\n    // Pump bytes from the incoming file (`__newFile`)\n    // to the outgoing stream towards the remote filesystem (`outs__`)\n    __newFile.pipe(outs__);\n\n\n    // Bind `finish` event for when the file has been completely written.\n    outs.once('finish', function () {\n      done();\n    });\n\n\n    // Handle potential error from the outgoing stream\n    outs__.on('error', function (err) {\n\n      // If this is not a fatal error (e.g. certain types of \"ECONNRESET\"s w/ S3)\n      // don't do anything.\n      if ( ! findOutIfIsFatalSomehow(err) ) return;\n\n      // The handling of this might vary adapter-to-adapter, but at some point, the\n      // `done` callback should be triggered w/ a properly formatted error object.\n      // Since calling `done(err)` will cause an `error` event to be emitted on the receiver,\n      // it is important to format the error in this way (esp. with code===E_WRITE) so it can\n      // be detected and discriminated from other types of errors that might be emitted from a\n      // receiver.\n      return done({\n        incoming: __newFile,\n        outgoing: outs__,\n        code: 'E_WRITE',\n        stack: typeof err === 'object' ? err.stack : new Error(err),\n        name: typeof err === 'object' ? err.name : err,\n        message: typeof err === 'object' ? err.message : err\n      });\n      // If this receiver is being used through Skipper, this event will be intercepted and, if possible\n      // (if the adapter implements the `rm` method) any bytes that were already written for this file\n      // will be garbage-collected.\n    });\n\n  };\n\n  return receiver__;\n}\n```\n\n\n========================================\n\n#### Specifying Options\n\nAll options may be passed in using any of the following approaches, in ascending priority order (e.g. the 3rd appraoch overrides the 1st)\n\n\n###### 1. In the blob adapter's factory method:\n\n```js\nvar blobAdapter = require('skipper-disk')({\n  // These options will be applied unless overridden.\n});\n```\n\n###### 2. In a call to the `.receive()` factory method:\n\n```js\nvar receiving = blobAdapter.receive({\n  // Options will be applied only to this particular receiver.\n});\n```\n\n###### 3. Directly into the `.upload()` method of the Upstream returned by `req.file()`:\n\n```js\nvar upstream = req.file('foo').upload({\n  // These options will be applied unless overridden.\n});\n```\n\n\n============================================\n\n\n## Status\n\nThis module is published on npm.
